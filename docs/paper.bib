	abstract = {Oceanic primary production forms the basis of the marine food web and provides a pathway for carbon sequestration. Despite its importance, spatial and temporal variations of primary production are poorly observed, in large part because the traditional measurement techniques are laborious and require the presence of a ship. More efficient methods are emerging that take advantage of miniaturized sensors integrated into autonomous platforms such as gliders and profiling floats. One such method relies on determining the diurnal cycle of dissolved oxygen in the mixed layer and has been applied successfully to measurements from gliders and mixed layer floats. This study is the first documented attempt to estimate primary production from diurnal oxygen changes measured by Argo-type profiling floats, thus accounting for the whole euphotic zone. We first present a novel method for correcting measurement errors that result from the relatively slow response time of the oxygen optode sensor. This correction relies on an \&lt;i\&gt;in-situ\&lt;/i\&gt; determination of the sensor's effective response time. The method is conceptually straightforward and requires only two minor adjustments in current Argo data transmission protocols: (1) transmission of measurement time stamps, and (2) occasional transmission of downcasts in addition to upcasts. Next, we present oxygen profiles collected by 10 profiling floats in the northern Gulf of Mexico, evaluate whether community production and respiration can be detected, and show evidence of internal oscillations influencing the diurnal oxygen signal. Our results show that profiling floats are capable of measuring diurnal oxygen variations although the confounding influence of physical processes does not permit a reliable estimation of biological rates in our data set. We offer suggestions for recognizing and removing the confounding signals.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Here we use a suite of physical, bio-optical and chemical measurements made during the 2008 spring bloom to optimize and compare three different models of biological carbon export. The observations are from a Lagrangian float that operated south of Iceland from early April to late June, and were calibrated with ship-based measurements. The simplest model is representative of typical NPZD models used for the North Atlantic, while the most complex model explicitly includes diatoms and the formation of fast sinking diatom aggregates and cysts under silicate limitation. We carried out a variational optimization and error analysis for the biological parameters of all three models, and compared their ability to replicate the observations. The observations were sufficient to constrain most phytoplankton-related model parameters to accuracies of better than 15 \%. However, the lack of zooplankton observations leads to large uncertainties in model parameters for grazing. The simulated vertical carbon flux at 100 m depth is similar between models and agrees well with available observations, but at 600 m the simulated flux is larger by a factor of 2.5 to 4.5 for the model with diatom aggregation. While none of the models can be formally rejected based on their misfit with the available observations, the model that includes export by diatom aggregation has a statistically significant better fit to the observations and more accurately represents the mechanisms and timing of carbon export based on observations not included in the optimization. Thus models that accurately simulate the upper 100 m do not necessarily accurately simulate export to deeper depths.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Rinko dissolved oxygen sensor was analyzed both in the laboratory and in the field. The main factor for the time response is the dynamic regime, i.e., the water flow around the sensor that influences the boundary layer's dynamics. Response times can be drastically reduced if the sensors are pumped. Laboratory experiments under different dynamic conditions showed a close to linear relation between response time and temperature. Application of a diffusion model including a stagnant boundary layer revealed that molecular diffusion determines the temperature behavior, and that the boundary layer thickness was temperature independent. Moreover, field experiments matched the laboratory findings, with the profiling speed and mode of attachment being of prime importance. The time response was characterized for typical deployments on shipboard CTDs, gliders, and floats, and tools are presented to predict the response time as well as to quantify the effect on the data for a given water mass profile. Finally, the problem of inverse filtering optode data to recover some of the information lost by their time response is addressed.},

	abstract = {The Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) program has begun deploying a large array of biogeochemical sensors on profiling floats in the Southern Ocean. As of February 2016, 86 floats have been deployed. Here the focus is on 56 floats with quality-controlled and adjusted data that have been in the water at least 6 months. The floats carry oxygen, nitrate, pH, chlorophyll fluorescence, and optical backscatter sensors. The raw data generated by these sensors can suffer from inaccurate initial calibrations and from sensor drift over time. Procedures to correct the data are defined. The initial accuracy of the adjusted concentrations is assessed by comparing the corrected data to laboratory measurements made on samples collected by a hydrographic cast with a rosette sampler at the float deployment station. The long-term accuracy of the corrected data is compared to the GLODAPv2 data set whenever a float made a profile within 20 km of a GLODAPv2 station. Based on these assessments, the fleet average oxygen data are accurate to 1 ± 1\%, nitrate to within 0.5 ± 0.5 µmol kg−1, and pH to 0.005 ± 0.007, where the error limit is 1 standard deviation of the fleet data. The bio-optical measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and optical backscatter are used to estimate chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon concentration. The particulate organic carbon concentrations inferred from optical backscatter appear accurate to with 35 mg C m−3 or 20\%, whichever is larger. Factors affecting the accuracy of the estimated chlorophyll a concentrations are evaluated.},

For accurate retrieval of Chl a concentrations acquired by in vivo fluorometer, a two-step procedure is applied: 1) A predeployment intercalibration with accurate determination by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, which not only calibrates fluorescence in appropriate Chl a concentration units, but also strongly reduces variability between fluorometers, and 2) a profile-by-profile quenching correction analysis, which effectively eliminates the fluorescence quenching issue at surface around noon, and results in consistent profiles between day and night. The quenching correction is conducted through an extrapolation of the deep fluorescence value toward surface. As proved by a validation procedure in the Western Mediterranean Sea, the correction method is practical and relatively reliable when there is no credible reference, especially for deep mixed waters, as in the Southern Ocean. Even in the shallow mixed waters, the method is also effective in reducing the influence of quenching.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Biogeochemical ocean models are useful tools subject to uncertainties arising from simplifications, inaccurate parameterization of processes, and poorly known model parameters. Parameter optimization is a standard method for addressing the latter but typically cannot constrain all biogeochemical parameters because of insufficient observations. Here we assess the trade-offs between satellite observations of ocean colour and biogeochemical (BGC) Argo profiles, and the benefits of combining both observation types, for optimizing biogeochemical parameters in a model of the Gulf of Mexico. A suite of optimization experiments is carried out using different combinations of satellite chlorophyll and profile measurements of chlorophyll, phytoplankton biomass, and particulate organic carbon (POC) from autonomous floats. As parameter optimization in 3D models is computationally expensive, we optimize the parameters in a 1D model version, and then perform 3D simulations using these parameters. We show first that the use of parameters optimized in 1D improves the skill of the 3D model. Parameters that are only optimized with respect to surface chlorophyll cannot reproduce subsurface distributions of biological fields. Adding profiles of chlorophyll in the parameter optimization yields significant improvements for surface and subsurface chlorophyll but does not accurately capture subsurface phytoplankton and POC distributions because the parameter for the maximum ratio of chlorophyll to phytoplankton carbon is not well constrained in that case. Using all available observations leads to significant improvements of both observed (chlorophyll, phytoplankton, and POC) and unobserved variables (e.g. primary production). Our results highlight the significant benefits of BGC Argo measurements for biogeochemical parameter optimization and model calibration.},

It uses climatological salinity interpolated to the float positions and observed θ surfaces and chooses 10 ‘best’ levels that are within well-mixed mode waters or deep homogeneous water masses. A piece-wise linear fit is used to estimate the temporally varying multiplicative adjustment to the float potential conductivities. An objective, statistical method is used to choose the breakpoints in the float time series where there are multiple drift trends. In the previous methods these breakpoints were chosen subjectively by manually splitting the time series into separate segments over which the fits were made. Our statistical procedure reduces the subjectivity by providing an automated way for doing the piece-wise linear fit. Uncertainties in this predicted adjustment are estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation. Examples of this new procedure as applied to two Argo floats are presented.},

	abstract = {Changes in technology have made it possible to gather vast amounts of data, often of high quality, that in turn can improve the quality of wildlife biology. However, with this growth in data, practices such as data management, exploratory data analysis, data-sharing, and reproducibility of an analysis have become increasingly complex. These practices often depend heavily on computer scripting languages, and are often hidden from the peer-review process despite their influence on the final results. Although these issues have been discussed in the literature, they are generally dealt with in a piecemeal fashion, preventing synthesis, and thereby slowing progress. We offer a conceptual framework to illustrate relationships among these practices, and show where wildlife biology as a field has embraced these changes, where awareness is growing, and where it lags behind other fields. We then present several case studies to emphasize the importance of adopting these practices. Any of these case studies could have been conducted with little attention to these practices or employing scripting languages, but there are many disadvantages to this approach including increased chance of errors, inefficiency, and lack of reproducibility. We suggest that a change in the culture of how wildlife biology is conducted is required and that this change will be fostered by integrating these practices into wildlife biology education, implementation, and embracing the idea of open data and open computer code. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.},

This globally averaged oxygen decrease is −0.93 ± 0.23μmol l−1, which is equivalent to annual oxygen losses of −0.55 ± 0.13 × 1014 mol yr−1(100–1000 m). The strongest decreases in oxygen occur in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, near regions where there is strong water renewal and exchange between the ocean interior and surface waters. Approximately 15\% of global oxygen decrease can be explained by a warmer mixed-layer reducing the capacity of water to store oxygen, while the remainder is consistent with an overall decrease in the exchange between surface waters and the ocean interior. Here we suggest that this reduction in water mass renewal rates on a global scale is a consequence of increased stratification caused by warmer surface waters.

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}BACKGROUND{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Oxygen concentrations in both the open ocean and coastal waters have been declining since at least the middle of the 20th century. This oxygen loss, or deoxygenation, is one of the most important changes occurring in an ocean increasingly modified by human activities that have raised temperatures, CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ levels, and nutrient inputs and have altered the abundances and distributions of marine species. Oxygen is fundamental to biological and biogeochemical processes in the ocean. Its decline can cause major changes in ocean productivity, biodiversity, and biogeochemical cycles. Analyses of direct measurements at sites around the world indicate that oxygen-minimum zones in the open ocean have expanded by several million square kilometers and that hundreds of coastal sites now have oxygen concentrations low enough to limit the distribution and abundance of animal populations and alter the cycling of important nutrients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}ADVANCES{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}In the open ocean, global warming, which is primarily caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions, is considered the primary cause of ongoing deoxygenation. Numerical models project further oxygen declines during the 21st century, even with ambitious emission reductions. Rising global temperatures decrease oxygen solubility in water, increase the rate of oxygen consumption via respiration, and are predicted to reduce the introduction of oxygen from the atmosphere and surface waters into the ocean interior by increasing stratification and weakening ocean overturning circulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In estuaries and other coastal systems strongly influenced by their watershed, oxygen declines have been caused by increased loadings of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and organic matter, primarily from agriculture; sewage; and the combustion of fossil fuels. In many regions, further increases in nitrogen discharges to coastal waters are projected as human populations and agricultural production rise. Climate change exacerbates oxygen decline in coastal systems through similar mechanisms as those in the open ocean, as well as by increasing nutrient delivery from watersheds that will experience increased precipitation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Expansion of low-oxygen zones can increase production of N$_{\textrm{2}}$O, a potent greenhouse gas; reduce eukaryote biodiversity; alter the structure of food webs; and negatively affect food security and livelihoods. Both acidification and increasing temperature are mechanistically linked with the process of deoxygenation and combine with low-oxygen conditions to affect biogeochemical, physiological, and ecological processes. However, an important paradox to consider in predicting large-scale effects of future deoxygenation is that high levels of productivity in nutrient-enriched coastal systems and upwelling areas associated with oxygen-minimum zones also support some of the world’s most prolific fisheries.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}OUTLOOK{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Major advances have been made toward understanding patterns, drivers, and consequences of ocean deoxygenation, but there is a need to improve predictions at large spatial and temporal scales important to ecosystem services provided by the ocean. Improved numerical models of oceanographic processes that control oxygen depletion and the large-scale influence of altered biogeochemical cycles are needed to better predict the magnitude and spatial patterns of deoxygenation in the open ocean, as well as feedbacks to climate. Developing and verifying the next generation of these models will require increased in situ observations and improved mechanistic understanding on a variety of scales. Models useful for managing nutrient loads can simulate oxygen loss in coastal waters with some skill, but their ability to project future oxygen loss is often hampered by insufficient data and climate model projections on drivers at appropriate temporal and spatial scales. Predicting deoxygenation-induced changes in ecosystem services and human welfare requires scaling effects that are measured on individual organisms to populations, food webs, and fisheries stocks; considering combined effects of deoxygenation and other ocean stressors; and placing an increased research emphasis on developing nations. Reducing the impacts of other stressors may provide some protection to species negatively affected by low-oxygen conditions. Ultimately, though, limiting deoxygenation and its negative effects will necessitate a substantial global decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as reductions in nutrient discharges to coastal waters.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Deep water formation supplies oxygen-rich water to the deep sea, spreading throughout the ocean by means of the global thermohaline circulation. Models suggest that dissolved gases in newly formed deep water do not come to equilibrium with the atmosphere. However, direct measurements during wintertime convection are scarce, and the controls over the extent of these disequilibria are poorly quantified. Here we show that, when convection reached deeper than 800 m, oxygen in the Labrador Sea was consistently undersaturated at −6.1\% to −7.6\% at the end of convection. Deeper convection resulted in greater undersaturation, while convection ending later in the year resulted in values closer to equilibrium, from which we produce a predictive relationship. We use dissolved oxygen data from six profiling Argo floats in the Labrador Sea between 2003 and 2016, allowing direct observations of wintertime convection. Three of the six optode oxygen sensors displayed substantial average in situ drift of −3.03 μmol O2 kg−1 yr−1 (−0.94\% O2 yr−1), which we corrected to stable deepwater oxygen values from repeat ship surveys. Observations of low oxygen intrusions during restratification and a simple mixing calculation demonstrate that lateral processes act to lower the oxygen inventory of the central Labrador Sea. This suggests that the Labrador Sea is a net sink for atmospheric oxygen, but uncertainties in parameterizing gas exchange limit our ability to quantify the net uptake. Our results constrain the oxygen concentration of newly formed Labrador Sea Water and allow more precise estimates of oxygen utilization and nutrient regeneration in this water mass.},

Despite its importance, spatial and temporal variations of primary production are poorly observed, in large part because the traditional measurement techniques are laborious and require the presence of a ship. More efficient methods are emerging that take advantage of miniaturized sensors integrated into autonomous platforms such as gliders and profiling floats. One such method relies on determining the diurnal cycle of dissolved oxygen in the mixed layer and has been applied successfully to measurements from gliders and mixed-layer floats. This study is the first documented attempt to estimate primary production from diurnal oxygen changes measured by Argo-type profiling floats, thus accounting for the whole euphotic zone. We first present a novel method for correcting measurement errors that result from the relatively slow response time of the oxygen optode sensor. This correction relies on an in situ determination of the sensor's effective response time. The method is conceptually straightforward and requires only two minor adjustments in current Argo data transmission protocols: (1) transmission of measurement time stamps and (2) occasional transmission of downcasts in addition to upcasts. Next, we present oxygen profiles collected by 10 profiling floats in the northern Gulf of Mexico, evaluate whether community production and respiration can be detected, and show evidence of internal oscillations influencing the diurnal oxygen signal. Our results show that profiling floats are capable of measuring diurnal oxygen variations although the confounding influence of physical processes does not permit a reliable estimation of biological rates in our dataset. We offer suggestions for recognizing and removing the confounding signals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Technology for measuring the deep ocean currents (including temperature and salinity) is now available using the recently Autonomous Profiling Explorer floats with electromagnetic sensors (APEX-EM) recently developed by Teledyne Webb Research. The float acquires temperature and salinity profiles using a Seabird sensor. In addition, the APEX-EM profiling floats were equipped with chemical and bio-optical sensors: Aanderaa Optode sensor measuring dissolved oxygen, and the WET Labs ECO Puck sensor which combines measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence (proxy of phytoplankton abundance), measurement of backscatter (as proxy of particle concentration) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence (incl. fluorophoric oil components). The ECO Puck was specifically designed to minimize space and power requirements for applications in autonomous measuring platforms, and is rated for sampling to 2000 m depth. Such technological advancements bringing together the physical and biochemical measurements have relevance on the response to subsurface oil spills such as Deepwater Horizon. Here we explore the impacts of wind-driven current on the biochemical response during the passage of a cold front in early May 2017 using profiles from multiple floats and shipboard data. During the frontal passage, surface friction velocity associated with the wind stress approached values of 0.6 m/s that forced strong near-inertial currents in the upper ocean of 0.75 m/s. The associated shear forced layer deepening of more than 20 m over the two days of frontal passage. The biochemical response indicated a dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence maxima at depths of 90-100 m during the event. This deep chlorophyll maximum tends to correspond to the oxycline lying between the 24-25 isopycnal in temperature and salinity space. During this period the floats resolved these responses as continuous measurements were acquired over time scales of a few hours. Thus, this float technology enables investigators to look more closely at the upper ocean response to strong forcing events that impacts biochemistry and hydrocarbon dispersion. Note that sampling rates can changed by updating mission profiles from continuous to profiling modes between specific depths to once every five to ten days to depths of up to 2000 m by changing the piston counts on the missions.},

However, the drivers of global oxygen subduction have not been fully described or quantified. Here, we address the physical mechanisms responsible for the oxygen transport across the late-winter mixed layer base and their relation with water mass formation. Up to 70\% of the global oxygen uptake takes place during Mode Water subduction mostly in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic. Te driving mechanisms are (i) the combination of strong currents with large mixed-layer-depth gradients at localized hot spots and (ii) the wind-driven vertical velocity within the subtropical gyres. Oxygen diffusion, despite being underestimated in this study, is likely to play an important role in the global ocean oxygenation. The physical mass flux dominates the total oxygen subduction while the oxygen solubility plays a minor role in its modulation.},

	abstract = {Recently, measurements of oxygen concentration in the ocean—one of the most classical parameters in chemical oceanography—are experiencing a revival. This is not surprising, given the key role of oxygen for assessing the status of the marine carbon cycle and feeling the pulse of the biological pump. The revival, however, has to a large extent been driven by the availability of robust optical oxygen sensors and their painstakingly thorough characterization. For autonomous observations, oxygen optodes are the sensors of choice: They are used abundantly on Biogeochemical-Argo floats, gliders and other autonomous oceanographic observation platforms. Still, data quality and accuracy are often suboptimal, in some part because sensor and data treatment are not always straightforward and/or sensor characteristics are not adequately taken into account. Here, we want to summarize the current knowledge about oxygen optodes, their working principle as well as their behavior with respect to oxygen, temperature, hydrostatic pressure, and response time. The focus will lie on the most widely used and accepted optodes made by Aanderaa and Sea-Bird. We revisit the essentials and caveats of in-situ in air calibration as well as of time response correction for profiling applications, and provide requirements for a successful field deployment. In addition, all required steps to post-correct oxygen optode data will be discussed. We hope this summary will serve as a comprehensive, yet concise reference to help people get started with oxygen observations, ensure successful sensor deployments and acquisition of highest quality data, and facilitate post-treatment of oxygen data. In the end, we hope that this will lead to more and higher-quality oxygen observations and help to advance our understanding of ocean biogeochemistry in a changing ocean.},
